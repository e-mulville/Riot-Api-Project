# Riot-Api-Project

This is my side project to familiarise myself with Python after mostly programming in C++.

As an intermediary goal to practice navigating the game list and manipulating data I will be making a fucntion to work out the average performance of a summoners teammates vs their oppenents.

The current goal is to work out key features in wins and losses using neural networks.

This will mostly exploit the Riot Games API to gain access to data from League of Legends.
